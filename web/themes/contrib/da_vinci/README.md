INTRODUCTION
------------
Da Vinci is a Drupal 8 theme. This theme is using Classy as base theme.
Its very light weight for fast loading with modern look.
Da Vinci uses:
  - Sass 3 - with sourcemaps
  - Gulp - 'A toolkit for automating painful or time-consuming tasks in your
  development workflow'. http://gulpjs.com/
  - Npm - To install and manage dependencies. https://www.npmjs.com/
  - Bower - A package manager that 'can manage components that contain HTML,
  CSS, JavaScript, fonts or even image files' https://bower.io/

And...
Like bower dependencies:
  - Susy 2 - Grid Framework.
  - Breakpoint - Helper for grid, excelent.
  - Bourbon Refills - http://refills.bourbon.io/
  - Sass Burger - For responsives menus.
Like npm dependencies:
  - Browsersync - See you changes in the browser without any reload
  (Using with Gulp).
  - Sass Globbing - Call your partials with /* or /** in your Main Sass.
  - SassLint & JsHint - Test your code!

REQUIREMENTS
------------
1.- Npm, which is installed with Node.js, which means that when you download
Node.js, you automatically get npm installed on your computer.
  To install Node.js v14:
    https://nodejs.org/es/download/
      or
    curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_14.x | sudo -E bash -
    sudo apt-get install -y nodejs

  Verify that Node.js and npm have been installed correctly:
    node -v
    npm -v

  To update npm version:
    npm install npm@latest -g

  If they are ok, that commands will show us the versions, for example:
  v6.x.x           (when npm -v)


2.- Gulp, to automate tasks, like Sass compiling or browser reload.
  To install Gulp:
    npm install -g gulp
    (Maybe, you need to use 'sudo')

  Verify that Gulp.js has been installed correctly:
    gulp -v
  If it's ok, that command will show us the following:
    CLI version x.x.x
    Local version undefined


INSTALLATION
------------
1.- Take a look at 'REQUIREMENTS' section above. You need all of these things.

2.- Read the 'USAGE' part and create your own subtheme.

3.- Go to your subtheme directory and install bower/npm dependencies:
  cd path-to-your-drupal/themes/custom/MYTHEMENAME
  npm install
  (Maybe you need to use 'sudo')

You're done :)


USAGE
-----
1.- CREATING A SUBTHEME:
You should never modify a theme that is packaged and released from Drupal.org
because, if you do, all your changes will be lost once that theme is updated.
Instead, you should create a subtheme. Once you've done that, you can override
styles, templates...

Run drush --include="themes/contrib/da_vinci" da_vinci:subtheme 'My Theme'

Optional options:
  - machine-name: The machine-readable name of your sub-theme. This will be
    auto-generated from the human-readable name if omitted.
  - description: The description of your sub-theme.
  - destination: The destination of your sub-theme.
  - starterkit: The name of the starter kit to use. By default it is default
    folder.

More info in starterkits directory (README.md file)


2.- USING GULP:
To launch Gulp, you only need to go to your subtheme directory and then write
'gulp' in command line.
This command displays all the ways for use gulp.

You can choose the command "gulp watch" too, which is much better so it shows
which files have been overriden and, if there were any, show errors.


3.- OVERRIDING AND ADDING STYLES:
Once you have your 'Gulp watch' launched, everytime you write in a sass/js file
and then save, Gulp will save your changes into main.css.
If you're not using 'gulp watch', you should do 'gulp styles:dev' (in a
development enviroment) after each change, then Gulp will compile once your
changes.

IMPORTANT: Remember don't edit the main.css files, because your changes will
be removed when Gulp compiles.

For more info, check README in /src and /assets/sass directory.


4.- OVERRIDING TEMPLATES:
Da Vinci is using Classy as base theme so an override is as simple as copying
one of Classy's templates into your templates directory.

More info in templates directory (README.md file)


5.- PREPROCESS:
You can affect the output of certain HTML via preprocess functions. For example,
 if you wanted to add a class to a menu and preferred to do this at the PHP
 level you can.

The main role of the preprocessors is to set up variables to be placed within
the template. If you need to preprocess theme variables for templates, you only
need to implement hooks for the chosen template in da_vinci.theme file.
- Create a function such as da_vinci_preprocess_HOOK where HOOK refers to the
item you wish to affect.
- Write your changes and save.
- Rebuild the cache so your changes are available.
